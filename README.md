# About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on predicting stock for Istanbul Stock Exchange. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

1. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Userhl0133/Stock-return-analysis/blob/main/Part%201_Data_Preparation_Cleaning.ipynb)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Userhl0133/Stock-return-analysis/blob/main/Part_2_EDA.ipynb)
3. [Model Analysis]

## Problem Definition

- What is the impact of each index on the return?
- Which model is the best for predict the stock return?
- How does model enhancement help change the prediction of the returns?

## Models Used
